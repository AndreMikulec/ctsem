\usage{
ctKalman(ctstanmodelobj, kalmanpars, datalong, subject)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctstanmodelobj}{model object as generated by \code{\link{ctModel}} using type='stanct' or 'standt'.}

\item{kalmanpars}{list object containing DRIFT,T0VAR,DIFFUSION,CINT,T0MEANS,TDPREDEFFECT,
MANIFESTMEANS, LAMBDA, and MANIFESTVAR matrices, with list elements named accordingly. A ctsem model of type 'omx',
fulfills these requirements, so long as full covariance matrices are specified instead of lower triangular.}

\item{datalong}{long format data object containing as used by \code{\link{ctStanFit}}.}

\item{subject}{integer denoting which subjects data to use.}
}
\description{
Takes list containing ctsem subject matrices, as well as long form data object, and calculates 
predicted and updated latent states, likelihoods, and predicted observations using the Kalman filter.
